ProgNovel is a JAMstack web app to make great webnovels. The main feature of ProgNovel, beside offline-first
web app with offline read features and great performance, is to be able to inject interactive plugins
for content creators to experiment with. Because ProgNovel built mainly in Jamstack architecture, it can be hosted with great loading page performance on many Jamstack platform free-tier offerings such as Netlify and Cloudflare Workers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON HIATUS! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

_THE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS BELOW MAY BE OBSOLETE IN FAVOR OF A NEW BACKEND CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S CURRENTLY NO ETA FOR THE PROJECT TO BE ACTIVE AGAIN AS I AM CURRENTLY IN SHORT OF FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT - BUT DO NOTE THAT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PROJECT IS ABANDONED BECAUSE EVEN IF I AM WORKING ON ANOTHER PROJECT, I AM USUALLY USING THE SAME STACK AND TECHNOLOGIES SO THE PROJECT CAN STILL BENEFITS FROM EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS TRIAL AND ERRORS FROM OTHER PROJECTS THAT I CAN USE LATER ON TO MAKE PROGNOVEL BETTER._

## (NEW 2024 PROJECT UPDATE)

There's another project that I'm currently working on that is halfway to public alpha. I learned a lot from this project, where it fails and where it can shine, and apply them to my next project.
I consider the new project as spiritual successor of ProgNovel so please stay tune!

## Self-host ProgNovel

Although ProgNovel strives to be as simple as possible, it is currently very difficult to create a smooth flow for deployment due to how young Jamstack ecosystem is (the architecture ProgNovel uses). In the future as the toolings more mature, we're hoping to simplify the deployment process - but for now we'll have to get our hands dirty and go through several steps in getting your ProgNovel ready.

ProgNovel works best when hosted on Jamstack platforms for performance and effiency purpose. Recommended platforms to host ProgNovel's frontend are Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Page.

> ‚ùó Before hosting the frontend, make sure you don't skip hosting your first ProgNovel backend on Cloudflare Workers and publishing content with ProgNovel CLI so that the frontend has something to build with.

1. You need to get your backend for ProgNovel where the content is hosted. For that you need to setup a local project of ProgNovel first by installing ProgNovel CLI to your computer. Follow [how to get your first content published with ProgNovel CLI here](https://github.com/prognoveljs/prognovel-cli).
2. Assuming that you already have a ready project with novels and settings already configured and filled with content chapters, it's time to upload your content to a backend for ProgNovel to serve readers all around the world. You can choose how you host your backend between of the statically and dynamically:

   - Host content with a Static API backend (Recommended)

     Hosting this way will make your backend behaves like a pseudo pre-built websites, but host `.json` files instead of `.html` files. The only platform to host ProgNovel Static API right now is Cloudflare Pages, chosen due to its global wide CDN network and price-wise has unlimited bandwidth even for its free-tier--meaning, you can setup your website for free and forget about it for years and it will still online, no matter how much traffic it takes.

     To setup a Static API for ProgNovel is simple; you need to upload your ProgNovel project to a Github repository and connect it from Cloudflare Pages dashboard. Create a new repo via [repo.new](https://repo.new/), upload content of project folder thyat you create with ProgNovel CLI, and connect the repo with Cloudflare Pages with these settings:

     ```
     PRODUCTION BRANCH: main
     BUILD COMMAND: npm run build
     BUILD OUTPUT DIRECTORY: /.publish
     ```

     **NOTE:** _note that all content hosted statically will be available their raw `.json` file to the public, so its possible to see content behind locked chapter via browsers' dev tools if you use Static API backend._

   - Host content with a Dynamic API backend

     ProgNovel will use Cloudflare Workers serverless platform to host your Dynamic API, in case if you don't use static API. This means it will bound to [Cloudflare Workers' limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits). Dynamic API might have features like secure locked chapters and Web Monetization receipt verification in the future.

     You need to host on Cloudflare Workers with some content already online on Cloudflare Workers network. [Read how to host a worker for Dynamic API ProgNovel backend here.](https://github.com/prognoveljs/prognovel-workers)

3. Click deploy button from this repo's readme. Fill the environment variable `BACKEND_API` with the backend URL you get from hosting your backend in the previous step. If your backend is Static API, make sure to set it with the url that ends with `.pages.dev`.

4. Wait for your hosting platforms building your ProgNovel App, which might takes 2~10 minutes depending on the hosting platform you used. Usually you'll be notified in the dashboard with the link of your newly created site once the build is complete.

## Upgrade your ProgNovel app

(WIP)

## Notes

- Technically, you can host ProgNovel frontend traditionally on a VPS (but not the backend). However it will be less optimized in term of performance and cost-value, and some pages will crash when directly entered their URL or reloading the page from their location. Therefore, ProgNovel will be limited on Jamstack and Serverless as its default hosting choice platform.
