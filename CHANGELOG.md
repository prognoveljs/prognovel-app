# ProgNovel Changelog

# 0.9.0

This version has a major breaking change where ProgNovel transitioning from full edge JAMstack web app to a more traditional with a web app with monolith backend. This change is taken due to consideration of low adoption and not-quite ready JAMstack ecosystem which make deployment complicated to many webmaster.

üìå **BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Backend no longer requires to be deployed in Cloudflare Workers
- **ProgNovel's Cloudflare Workers backend is now obselete** and may breaks in production.
- **Dropping ProgNovel CLI** in favor of user dashboard and backend connected text editor for content management.
- Some features (such as rev shares) might be missing temporary during the transition period

üéâ FEATURES ADDED:
- Backend now provides user authentication features that can be linked with Social Sign In Oauth (Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Github, Discord, etc)
- Webmaster now can allow regular users to upload their own novels and contents
- Add (a very early phase) coin system, along with free daily coin
- Add user profile feature
- Add user status feature
- Users now can follow each other
- Users now can follow novels

üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- Now with darker background as default

# 0.8.0

This version adds "Infinite Reading" option that will load chapters automatically on page scroll instead of clicking next chapter button. One chapter per page with next button is now "Classic Mode" and can be switched to "Infinite Reading" in read page's setting Layout and Themes section. Note that this is still too early to say that Infinite Reading mode is bug free so if you encounter any bugs, please raise an issue at https://github.com/prognoveljs/prognovel-app/issues.

Another notable feature in this version also allow authors to hide chapters' titles in a blurred spoiler, which is only available if used with recent versions of ProgNovel CLI and backend.

üéâ FEATURES ADDED:
- Infinite reading option is now available
- Now chapter titles can be blurred in a spoiler, which can be revealed on mouse hover or click, as well on tap in case for mobile devices 
- To hide chapter title in spoiler, authors can set `spoiler: true` in chapter markdown's frontmatter (the same place to set the chapter's title)
- Chapter spoiler feature requires at least ProgNovel CLI v0.8.7 and ProgNovel Backend v0.6.5 to work.

üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- (novel page) add background patters on the bottom of novel page
- (home page) add background patters on the bottom of novel promo
- (read page) rework botton chapter navigation to uses new navigation UI from novel page
- Fix settings modal images 404 not found

üõ†Ô∏è INTERNAL:
- Upgrade SvelteKit and Vite to latest versions. This might bring hidden bugs from SvelteKit's recent breaking changes.
- Refactor chapter navigation to its own component and rework its dependency store accordingly

# 0.7.9

I'll try to make this version changelog to be more readable with some commentary about the changes, rather than some random logs than I directly copy-paste'd from codebase commits. I hope the changes more readable from now on.

In this version, there some fixes to search result as well greatly enhance its UX on mobile device. I haven't been testing ProgNovel on mobile recently and wasn't aware the UX on mobile for searchbar is abysmal - and this patch should fixes most of the issues for mobile users.

Other changes also includes some adjustment to UI like for read page's option section headers, and "READ NOW" button on novel page has been reworked to include some hover animation, adding icon and changing the label to "Begin reading" or "Continue reading" (if reader has read the novel). There also minor enhancement where at the bottom of button, title of the novel chapter is being displayed to give readers some idea where the button will direct them to.

## Changelogs:

üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- (novel page) rework read now button, change label to "Begin reading", add "fetch info..." label when loading, new subtle animations and show destination chapter title
- (novel page) Allow to continue reading from novel page, based on reader's last chapter read
- (read page) adjust color and add icons for section headers in read page option tab
- (searchbar) now has close button both on desktop and mobile versions
- (searchbar) on mobile, scrolling/swipping down the search result will lose the focus on searchbar, disabling the mobile keyboard and thus giving the search result larger view of the screen
- (search result) on mobile, tapping search result will focus on the novel and reveal its full title, while tap the second time will make direct the page to the novel's page like it originally behaves
